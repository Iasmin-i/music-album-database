Java program integrating MariaDB database. The program displays the database's table, and doesn't perform any other operation. 

#### Note:

In future programs, some modifications can be made: 

- Make the program more secure by not showing the passwords directly;
- Add more SQL operations to the code as: INSERT, DROP, ALTER.
